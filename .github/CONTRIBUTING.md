# Contributing to auto-ngtemplate-loader

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use Github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
1. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
1. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
1. Ensure the test suite passes.
1. Make sure your code lints.
1. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/yashdalfthegray/auto-ngtemplate-loader/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People _love_ thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

The code follows the [Airbnb's Javascript guidelines](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) with some changes that can be found in the `.eslintrc.json`. This project also uses prettier to auto format the code to read consistent.

As a general rule of thumb, always run `npm test` and `npm run linter` before turning in a contribution. Github Actions will also run the other test cases listed in `package.json` but feel free to run them yourself as well.

## Cutting a new release

The procedure for cutting a new release is as follows

- Create an entry in `CHANGELOG.md` detailing the changes for this release.
- Update `package.json` and `package-lock.json` to reflect the new version.
- Push these changes to the `main` branch.
- Create a new PR from `main` to `stable`.
- Wait for the approval checks to pass and merge the PR.
- Fetch, checkout, and pull the `stable` branch.
- Run `npm pack && tar -xvzf *.tgz && rm -rf package *.tgz` to check the files that will be included in the release.
- Run `npm publish` to publish the new version to npm.
