## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use the vulnerability issue template to report a vulnerability. You can expect communication on the day that a vulnerability is submitted with a plan to resolve to follow in the next day. This project is maintained in my free time so any help that you can offer towards resolution of particular vulnerability would be welcome!

Once a vulnerability starts being worked on, you can expect updates from the author every 1-2 days.
